Basic working with Vim, tips and tricks.

= Modes =

== Normal ==
When you enter in Vim, you are in *normal* mode. You _can not_ insert text in normal mode, but move through texts, buffers, tabs,.. , and execute commands like copy and paste, search and replace, open and safe files, etc.

Independently the mode you are, you always can return to normal mode pressing `ESC`.

_Normally_ you _want_ to be in *normal* mode.

== Insert ==
From *normal* mode you can switch to *insert* mode to insert text, pressing `i` (for example). In *insert* mode everything you type will be inserted in the text as in any other text editor.

There are many ways to switch to insert mode:
  * Insert here: pressing `i`.
  * Insert at the beginning of the line: pressing `I` (capital `i`).
  * Insert after the character where the cursor is: pressing `a`.
  * Insert at the end of the line: pressing `A`.
  * Insert an empty line below the line the cursor is, and insert at it: pressing `o`.
  * Insert an empty line over the line the cursor is, and insert at it: pressing `O` (capital `o`).
